# AWS_Elastic_Beanstalk
This is the repository to host your MVC application in AWS elastic beanstalk and using dynamodb for storaging the data.
This reposiory would allows registered  users to upload/download movie, write comments, rate the movie. 
I have implemented a Web application by using ASP.NET Core MVC application . I have hardcoded the users login credentials in the dynamoDB as I didn't implement the sign up page as well as the dynamodb for storing users. I hardcoded the two users in dynamodb and then the registered users can comment and give rating to the movies. In the end , I hosted this application in AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
